## Challenge Solution & Mobile-First

Comparing to my solution.

### Writing the HTML

He creates a `<section>` rather than a `<header>`.
He also uses BEM (i.e. `.intro__text` rather than `.intro p`).
He's also using containers within the sections, like I am.
He's also using the row -> column structure, like I am; but he's having `col` be a separate div rather than applying it on the p tag directly.
He's putting the image within a col div, rather than by itself.
