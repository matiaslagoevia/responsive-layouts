# Day 17

## The viewport meta tag

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`

Included automatically with Emmet templates/HTML5 stuff.
Ensures website will be responsive the way we want it to be.
The viewport's width is the device width, and the initial scale is 1 (we don't zoom in/out).
Without it, whole website just shrinks as is.
