# Day 20

## Mobile navigation challenge solution

Some of the same changes, he did the separation much easier in some parts but ignored the button spacing being equal size, maybe I was too much into it then? Other than the hamburger/dropdown/visibility aspect, the layout is simpler in mobile-first.

For the desktop version, it looks like he has the nav w/o position absolute? absolute removes the element from the document flow, and so it's useful to hide w/o padding/etc on the bar. Nvm he addresses the postion absolute bit :)
