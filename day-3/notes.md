## Enter max-width

Normally we don't want to let things stretch too far/from one side of the screen to the other.
Usually, this is because of how our eyes read text — it's more convenient to look at the content without having to turn your head/etc.
max-width solves this problem.
We cannot have max-width have percentages alongside width ones; we have to use a fixed unit (like pixels) on it.
