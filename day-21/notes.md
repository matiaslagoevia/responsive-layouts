# Day 21

## End of course

### Recap

- Websites are responsive before we write any CSS
- When our layouts run into issues, we're at fault
- Usually (not always), a desktop-first approach is the culprit
- Mobile-first CSS tends to be the easiest way around it, even with only a desktop spec
- Basics of flexbox, but a lot more to it
- Grid as well
- Don't rush things
- Mastering anything isn't as much as you possibly can/cramming things
